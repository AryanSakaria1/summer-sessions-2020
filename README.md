# Summer Sessions 2020
Series of online lectures and hands-on tutorials organized to familiarize new lab entrants with the fundamental areas of robotics research.

## Where and When?
* Microsoft Teams. Timings: 3 pm - 4:30 pm (can extend by 30 mins for discussing assignments/quizzes)

## Tentative Schedule
* UPDATE: The below schedule will be pushed by 3-4 days and will likely start around 13/5. Because of the current circumstances, it will take a few days to confirm the final starting date (You will be mailed when it is confirmed). However, the rest of the schedule such as the sequence of the sessions will remain the same. Please keep checking this page or you can subscribe to [RSS feed](https://github.com/RoboticsIIITH/summer-sessions-2020/commits/master.atom) for real time updates. Please bear with us in these uncertain times.

## Assignments

### Plan for assignments/quizzes

If an assignment is given for a particular concept, we have given a break of 1 day before next concept begins for solving this assignment. Also, the solutions to this assignment will be discussed at the end of next session, for example math review assignment will be discussed at the end of 3rd session (or sometimes at the beginning of the next session in which case the session will start early). But the discussion will be brief for about 30 minutes and you will not be able to follow if you haven't solved the assignment, so please solve it beforehand. 

The presenter will confirm the assignment discussion session timings at the end of his sessions.

Regarding quizzes, they will be at the end of a particular session itself to gauge how much you have learned during that session.

* Note: Assignments and/or quizzes are not being held for every topic, check the below tables for more details. 

### Assignment Schedule
| Assignment No. | Duration for solving |       Topic      |       File Link        | Date of discussion|
|:--------------:|:------------:|:----------------:|:------------------:|:-------:|
|1 | 10-11/05 | Linear Algebra & Calculus| TBD | 12/05 |
|2 & 3| TBD | Deep Learning | TBD | TBD |
|4 | TBD | ROS | TBD | TBD |
|5 | TBD | Transformations | TBD | TBD |
|6 | TBD | Projective Geometry  | TBD | TBD |
|7-8 | TBD | MVG + BA | TBD | TBD |
|9 | TBD | State Estimation (ST)  | TBD | TBD |
|10| TBD | Visual Servoing | TBD | TBD |

ST stands for Short assignment.

* Note: Do not get intimidated by looking at the volume of the assignments, we have designed the schedule ensuring that you have enough time between sessions to solve each assignment.

### Quiz Schedule
(At the end of a particular session)

| Quiz No. |     Topic      |
|:--------------:|:------------:|
|1-4 | Deep Learning| 
|5-6 | Transformations and Projective Geometry| 
|7-8 | MVG|
